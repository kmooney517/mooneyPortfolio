      <h3>Live Etsy Clone</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/kmooney517/liveEtsyPage">GitHub Repository</a><br>
      <a href="http://kmooney517.github.io/etsyPage">Live Application</a>
      <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JS, SASS</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> This project is a clone of a live Etsy page when a user inputs the search term: 'star wars.'  This was one of the first projects that I used ajax requests to get JSON data from a live API instead of using hard coded data from a given set.  All of the styling is done in pure CSS/SASS.  Each item tile is live and will bring you to the specific items' landing page.  The outer areas are styled and set up accordingly - but are not live.</p>

      <h3>Wat Wars</h3>

      <a href="http://watwars.surge.sh">Live Application</a>
      <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JS, SASS, Underscore, jQuery, moment.js</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Wat Wars is a turn-based game built in JavaScript.  Users are able to select a character and an opponent, then go to battle by selecting one of four moves from the battle screen.  Each attack does random amounts of damage and the outcome of each fight is a different result. (Who wouldn't want to pit Bob Ross vs. Barney Stinson?!) The main component of this project dealt with understanding and utilizing the different facets of constructors and instances of constructor functions.</p>

      <a href="http://gradient.surge.sh/#/">Live Application</a>
      <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JS, SASS, jQuery, AngularJS, Foundation, Bourbon, Neat, PARSE</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gradient is a project that I have been wanting to build for a while now. It is written using the AngularJS framework.  The application is essentially an interactive notebook to track how many days a user has spent on a given river.  Users are able to input a wide array of details about their daily river experiences and look back on their memories at a later date.  I plan to continue this assignment by completed a login/account process with PARSE, using a river information API to add in specific rivers, and add in outdoor gear based API's to add in specifics about gear that was used on a specifc day.</p>

      <h3>Duck Bills</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/kmooney517/billShare">GitHub Repository</a><br>
      <a href="http://duckbills.surge.sh">Live Application</a>
      <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JS, SASS, jQuery, AngularJS, Foundation, Bourbon, Neat, Ruby on Rails Backend</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> I completed Duck Bills during The Iron Yard hackathon event.  I worked with a team of two other front end developers and two back end developers.  We were presented with the idea to create a bill sharing app for roomates to better split the bills and were to complete and pitch the idea in 48 hours.  My main roles in the project include: creating the login and create account features + accompanying interactions with the rails team, working on the edit bills feature, and the majority of the styling and design work.</p>
